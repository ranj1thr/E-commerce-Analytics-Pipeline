# E-commerce-Analytics-Pipeline

A complete pipeline for managing, analyzing, and visualizing e-commerce sales data from Amazon and Flipkart using Python, PostgreSQL, Metabase, and Docker. This project demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, data transformation using SQL, and creating interactive dashboards for business insights.

## Project Overview

This project streamlines the process of analyzing sales data by integrating data from multiple e-commerce platforms into a unified PostgreSQL database. It enables automated data cleaning, transformation, and visualization for actionable business insights.

### Key Features:
- **Automated ETL Process:** Upload and process Amazon and Flipkart sales data using Python.
- **Unified Data View:** Standardize and combine data from multiple platforms using advanced SQL queries.
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Visualize key metrics, trends, and KPIs in Metabase.
- **Technologies Used:** Python, PostgreSQL, Metabase, and Docker.

## Workflow

### 1. Data Upload and Processing
**Input Data:** Sales data from Amazon and Flipkart in `.csv` or `.xlsx` formats.

**ETL Process:**
- The `upload_to_postgres.py` script automates:
  - Uploading sales data to PostgreSQL.
  - Deduplication of records using a hash-based `unique_id`.
  - Dynamic creation or updating of tables in PostgreSQL.

---

### 2. Data Transformation
- The SQL query in `combined_data_query.sql` performs:
  - Combining Amazon and Flipkart sales data into a single unified dataset.
  - Standardizing columns like `brand`, `SKU`, and `GMV`.
  - Enriching data by joining with additional pricing and product tables.

---

### 3. Data Visualization
**Metabase** Dashboards:
- Provides actionable insights on sales performance, brand contributions, and top-performing SKUs.
- Enables dynamic filtering by date, platform, and fulfillment channels.

---

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
-  Install **Docker** and **PostgreSQL** on your machine.
-  Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ranj1thr/E-commerce-Analytics-Pipeline.git
   cd E-commerce-Analytics-Pipeline
   
### Run Metabase with Docker
- Navigate to the `docker` folder (if applicable) and run:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up

### Upload Data to PostgreSQL
- Place your Amazon and Flipkart sales files in the `data/` folder.
- Run the ETL script:
  ```bash
  python scripts/upload_to_postgres.py

    ```


### Transform Data with SQL
- Use the `combined_data_query.sql` file to transform and unify the data within PostgreSQL.

---

### Visualize Data in Metabase

- Connect **Metabase** to your PostgreSQL database.
- Use the SQL query or pre-configured dataset to create interactive dashboards.

---

## Dashboard Overview

### Sample Dashboard

#### Key Visualizations:

- **Gross Price by Platform**: Breakdown of total sales by Amazon and Flipkart.
- **Brand Performance**: Pie charts showing the distribution of sales across different brands.
- **Top 10 SKUs**: Tables showcasing the most sold products on each platform.
- **Filters**: Dynamic filters for date range, platform, and fulfillment method.

---

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: For automating data ingestion and transformation.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing and querying sales data.
- **Metabase**: Business intelligence tool for creating dashboards.
- **Docker**: Used to run Metabase in a local container.

## Future Enhancements
- Automate data extraction directly from Amazon and Flipkart APIs.
- Implement scheduling for ETL tasks using Apache Airflow or cron jobs.
- Add advanced KPIs like profit margin analysis and customer segmentation.
